● I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in [Meredith Ecosystem Genomics Lab](https://www.laurameredith.com/), working at University of Arizona and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory since 2023.

● Prior to joining UArizona, I received my Ph.D. at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Kinglun Yeung](https://www.kinglunyeung.com/) and [Prof. Joseph Kwan](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/people/joseph-kai-cho-kwan/); and my Bachelor degree at Zhejiang University in 2017.

● I am mainly focusing on the integration of multi-omics datasets including volatilomics, metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to investigate how trace VOCs, produced by microbial, plant, and abiotic processes, enhance soil carbon storage.
